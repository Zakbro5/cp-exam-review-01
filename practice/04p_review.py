'''
INTEGRATE YOUR FUNCTION INTO LOOPING LOGIC
------------------------------------------
You are provided with code for the looping logic that you did in practice 2,
as well as a function that will count the number of courses for a student.

Add the logic for option 3:
- Ask for a student name
- Using the returned value of the count_courses function, print out a message
  saying:
    "Student <student name> is taking <number of courses> courses.

        # WRITE YOUR LOGIC HERE
        pass # pass does literally nothing. It is just a way to make python not yell at you when the code is expecting something.
